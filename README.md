# KhanWebDevelopers
Week1 project team: Bassan, Yoosef, Denis

## Why?
Khan Web Developers is a very successful company. We have all of the best customers in several fields of business. We are building this website to attract new customers to join our existing customer base. Additionally, this website will be used by our current customers to learn more about us and get in contact with us.

## What?
Our site will need:

* A clear headline
* A short, sharp section about us, our services, our values and what makes us the best
* A easy to use navigation bar with perfect UX. (stretch: for mobile, put the navigation bar at the bottom)
* A user filled form which sends potential customer details to one of the Khan Web Developers. Details must include: name, email, message, phone number. (stretch: validate the email and phone number)
* The site should only be one single page (stretch: add smooth scroll functionality to the navigation bar)
* Design the site with mobile first in mind. Ensure that UX is good on all devices.
* Make sure that the accessibility on the site is strong. Pick contrasting colours for readabilty. Put in alt for images.
* Make sure that ChromeVox works well with our site and that Tabs work in a logical order.
* Make sure that the site will be functional even if javascript is disables.
